Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family

Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Cricket career

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]

On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]

Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election.[178] His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family
Further information: Family of Imran Khan

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Cricket career

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

Khan at a political rally in Peshawar in 1996
In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]


Khan tearing his nomination paper for the National Assembly at a press conference; he boycotted the 2008 elections.
On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]


Khan meets U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in August 2013 while he was in opposition
Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election.[178] His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

Environment and energy

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family
Further information: Family of Imran Khan

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Cricket career

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy
Main articles: Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre and Namal College
Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]

On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]


Khan meets U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in August 2013 while he was in opposition
Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election.[178] His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family
Further information: Family of Imran Khan

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Cricket career

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]


Khan tearing his nomination paper for the National Assembly at a press conference; he boycotted the 2008 elections.
On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]


Khan meets U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in August 2013 while he was in opposition
Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election.[178] His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

Environment and energy

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family
Further information: Family of Imran Khan

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Cricket career

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

Khan at a political rally in Peshawar in 1996
In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]

On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]


Khan meets U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in August 2013 while he was in opposition
Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election.[178] His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

Environment and energy

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]

Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

Khan at a political rally in Peshawar in 1996
In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]


Khan tearing his nomination paper for the National Assembly at a press conference; he boycotted the 2008 elections.
On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]

Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election.[178] His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

Environment and energy

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family
Further information: Family of Imran Khan

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

Khan at a political rally in Peshawar in 1996
In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]


Khan tearing his nomination paper for the National Assembly at a press conference; he boycotted the 2008 elections.
On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]

Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

Environment and energy

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Cricket career

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

Khan at a political rally in Peshawar in 1996
In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]

On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]


Khan meets U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in August 2013 while he was in opposition
Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Cricket career

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

Khan at a political rally in Peshawar in 1996
In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]

On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections
See also: Pakistani general election, 2013

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]


Khan meets U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in August 2013 while he was in opposition
Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Cricket career

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

Khan at a political rally in Peshawar in 1996
In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]


Khan tearing his nomination paper for the National Assembly at a press conference; he boycotted the 2008 elections.
On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections
See also: Pakistani general election, 2013

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]


Khan meets U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in August 2013 while he was in opposition
Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election.[178] His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

Environment and energy

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family
Further information: Family of Imran Khan

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Cricket career

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

Khan at a political rally in Peshawar in 1996
In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]


Khan tearing his nomination paper for the National Assembly at a press conference; he boycotted the 2008 elections.
On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]

Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election.[178] His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family
Further information: Family of Imran Khan

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Cricket career

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]

On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]


Khan meets U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in August 2013 while he was in opposition
Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election.[178] His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

Khan, accompanied by his finance minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh and other cabinet members, meets US President Donald Trump and his secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross, among others, at the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland, in 2020
On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

Environment and energy

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family
Further information: Family of Imran Khan

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Cricket career

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]


Khan tearing his nomination paper for the National Assembly at a press conference; he boycotted the 2008 elections.
On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]


Khan meets U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in August 2013 while he was in opposition
Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election.[178] His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

Environment and energy

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family
Further information: Family of Imran Khan

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

Khan at a political rally in Peshawar in 1996
In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]


Khan tearing his nomination paper for the National Assembly at a press conference; he boycotted the 2008 elections.
On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]

Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

Khan was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018 after his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won the 2018 Pakistani general election.[178] His first major military appointment was Lt. General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

Environment and energy

In July 2018, then Chief Justice of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar, launched a fundraiser for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.[188] Khan urged overseas Pakistanis to support Nisar's fundraiser.[189]

In September 2018, Khan launched the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.[190]

In June 2020, Khan attended the signing ceremony for the $2.5 billion Kohala Hydropower Project (1,124 MW).[191] In July 2020, Khan announced the establishment of 15 national parks under the Protected Areas Initiative.[192] In December 2020, Khan announced at the Climate Ambition Summit that Pakistan would scrap two coal projects (2,600 MW) and aim for 60% renewable energy by 2030.[193]

In September 2022, The Nation reported the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found over Rs3.49 billion in irregularities in the 10-Billion Tree Tsunami, including fake reports, over-claimed areas (Rs305.523 million), overlapping plantations, and uncertified seeds (Rs109.365 million).[194]

As of November 2023, the dams fund was Rs17.86 billion.[188]
Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi[a] (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former cricketer, philanthropist, and politician who served as the 19th prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. As a cricketer, he led Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory. After retiring from cricket, Khan founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan's first cancer hospital. He is the founder of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and was its chairman from 1996 to 2023.

Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan is also credited with advancing the idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy. Khan led Pakistan to its first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987. Playing until 1992, he captained the Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to achieving the all-rounder's triple of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets in Tests, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets as a captain in Test cricket, along with the second-best bowling figures in an innings. Moreover, he has won the most Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth overall in Test history. In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In his bachelorhood, Khan was known as a hedonistic playboy who had numerous relationships and was a regular in London's nightlife. Khan's first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, was, in his words, the one woman he truly loved before his first marriage. Khan had a relationship with Ana-Luisa (Sita) White, daughter of industrialist Gordon White, and was later legally declared the father of her daughter Tyrian Jade, though he denied paternity.[b] Khan dated German MTV host Kristiane Backer, introducing her to Islam; she later converted after their breakup. He married Jemima Goldsmith in 1995, had two sons, and divorced in 2004 due to her difficulty adjusting to life in Pakistan. Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in January 2015, but they divorced in October the same year. Khan married his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi on 18 February 2018.

Khan initially welcomed General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état. He became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the first time in the 2002 general election and contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from five constituencies, becoming the first in Pakistan's electoral history to win all of them. He was elected prime minister in a PTI-led coalition government. During COVID-19 in Pakistan, Khan launched Pakistan's largest welfare programme. In February 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister in two decades to visit Moscow, arriving on the very day the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. During his premiership, Khan had been very vocal against Islamophobia. In April 2022, Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister to be removed from office through a no-confidence motion. Khan alleged foreign interference and US involvement in his removal,[c] blaming Washington for opposing his foreign policy that strengthened ties with China and Russia.

In October that year, Khan was disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan for one term from assuming office in the National Assembly of Pakistan due to the Toshakhana case. In November, he survived an assassination attempt at a political rally in Wazirabad. In May 2023, Khan was attending a hearing on corruption charges when paramilitary forces stormed into the Islamabad High Court and arrested him. Protests broke out throughout Pakistan, some turning into violent riots. Subsequently, his arrest was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. In August 2023, he was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession. He was subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison in early 2024 for leaking state secrets and violating the Official Secrets Act, and an additional seven years for breaching Islamic marriage laws with his wife; both of these sentences were overturned in mid-2024. Khan has since been charged on matters related to the 2023 riots, clashes between his supporters and police in September 2024, and in the Al-Qadir Trust case in January 2025, receiving a 14-year sentence. As of December 2024, court records showed that 186 cases were filed against Khan all over Pakistan.

Early life and family
Further information: Family of Imran Khan

Khan with his uncle Javed Zaman,[4] who would later become his cricket mentor, c. 1957.
Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[5][d] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife, Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[8] Paternally, Khan is of Pathan origin from the Niazi tribe.[9][10] Khan's maternal family is from the Burki community,[11] having lived near Jalandhar for centuries before migrating to Pakistan after Independence in 1947.[12][13]

He attended Aitchison College and Cathedral School in Lahore.[14][15] Khan arrived at Royal Grammar School Worcester in England in September 1971 and excelled at cricket.[16][17] In 1972, after being turned down by Cambridge University,[18] Khan was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics, graduating in 1975.[19] Paul Hayes, a cricket enthusiast, helped facilitate his entry.[18]

Personal life
Khan had numerous relationships in his bachelorhood.[20] He was known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active in London's nightlife, often visiting Tramp in St James's.[21][22] One or two of his girlfriends were called "mysterious blondes" in British tabloids. During the 1980s and 1990s, Khan was regarded as one of the most eligible bachelors.[23]

His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites. The Times states Emma was the "one woman he truly loved before his first marriage."[23] They met in 1982 and visited Pakistan. She accompanied him everywhere, including a hunting trip to Peshawar and a cricket tour to Australia.[24] She painted Khan's portrait during their relationship at his request.[25] Khan's Chelsea residence, near Sergeant's studio and Tramp, became central to his social life. After long separations, their relationship ended in 1986.[23]

Jonathan Orders introduced Khan to Susie Murray-Philipson, whom he later invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982. Their relationship did not progress, as Philipson felt out of place and found cultural differences irreconcilable. He also briefly dated Susannah Constantine, whom he met through Lulu Blacker; their relationship lasted about a year. Julia Verdin and Doone Murray were among other women associated with Khan, with their relationships receiving media attention.[23]

Other women associated with Khan during this period include Zeenat Aman,[26] Sarah Crawley, Marie Helvin,[23] Stephanie Beacham, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Goldie Hawn, Sarah Giles,[27] Anastasia Cooke, and Hannah Rothschild. These relationships did not last, as Khan required residency in Pakistan for a serious, long-term commitment.[24]

Ana-Luisa White, daughter of British industrialist Gordon White and later known as Sita, began her relationship with Khan in 1986, shortly after his breakup with Emma Sergeant. The relationship lasted two years, ending when Khan reportedly wrote that he could not love her as Emma would always be the love of his life. White became pregnant after a final encounter in 1991 and gave birth to a daughter, Tyrian Jade,[28][29] in June 1992. She later claimed Khan was the father and kept a framed photograph of him.[24] Tyrian became the subject of a legal dispute in 1997 when a California court ruled Khan her father after White filed a paternity suit. The ruling followed Khan's failure to respond to the suit or a blood test request.[30] Khan denied paternity and said that since he does not live in California or England, he welcomes White to Pakistan, where he lives, and would prefer to present his side in a Pakistani court rather than in an "undignified trial by media." He requested a paternity test in Pakistan, saying he would accept the decision of the local courts.[31] After White's death in 2004, Jemima, Khan's wife and a friend of Sita, was named Tyrian's legal guardian in her will. Khan said Tyrian could join their family in London, leaving the decision to her due to her relationship with his and Jemima's sons.[32]

In August 1992, Khan began dating Kristiane Backer, a German MTV host. Their nearly two-year relationship included him introducing her to Islam. After it ended, she converted to Islam following a meeting with Khan in 1995.[33]

Khan and Jemima Goldsmith confirmed their engagement on 12 May 1995. The couple said they would marry, with Khan stating Jemima converted to Islam "through her own convictions" after studying the religion. Both families approved of the match. A spokesperson for her father denied rumours that Jemima was pregnant.[34] On 16 May 1995, the couple married in a brief two-minute Islamic ceremony in Paris. On 21 June, they had a civil ceremony at the Richmond register office before moving to Lahore. They had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim.[35] On 22 June 2004, the couple divorced, ending their nine-year marriage as it was "difficult for Jemima to adapt to life in Pakistan."[36]

On 8 January 2015, Khan married British-Pakistani journalist Reham Khan in a private Nikah ceremony at his Islamabad residence.[37] On 22 October 2015, they announced plans to divorce.[38]

In 2016, media speculated about Khan’s possible third marriage, linked to his spiritual ties with the Maneka family of Pakpattan. Reports claimed he visited Pakpattan several times in July to meet Maryam Riaz Wattoo, sister of his spiritual guide Bushra Bibi. Khan dismissed the claims as "absolutely baseless".[39] Members of the Manika family also denied the rumour.[40] Khan called the media "unethical" for spreading it,[41] and PTI filed a complaint against the channels involved.[42]

In 2017, PTI member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that Khan, then party chairman, sexually harassed her.[43] Gulalai said Khan had sent her "inappropriate text messages",[44] beginning in 2013.[45][46] Khan supported Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's proposal for a special committee to investigate the claims. He said he had not sent "indecent messages" to Gulalai and "challenge[d] the [proposed] committee to find [the indecent texts] if there are any".[47] Khan refused to cooperate with a bipartisan committee formed to investigate Gulalai's allegations and filed a defamation suit against her. No inquiry was ultimately conducted, and Gulalai did not publicly release the alleged messages.[45]

On 7 January 2018, the PTI central secretariat said Khan had proposed to Bushra, but she had not yet accepted.[48] On 18 February 2018, PTI confirmed Khan had married Bushra.[49] The mufti who conducted the marriage later testified that Khan's nikah was performed twice. He said the first, on 1 January 2018, occurred while Bushra was still in iddat, and alleged Khan believed marrying on that date would help him become prime minister.[50]

As of 2018, Khan owned five dogs, including Motu at his Bani Gala estate.[51]

Khan made his first-class debut at 16 in Lahore. By the early 1970s, he played for hometown teams: Lahore A,[e] Lahore B,[f] Lahore Greens,[g] and Lahore.[h][52] He was part of the University of Oxford Blues Cricket team from 1973 to 1975.[19] Between 1971 and 1976, Khan played English county cricket for Worcestershire and also represented Dawood Industries[i] and Pakistan International Airlines.[j] From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[52]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[53] In August 1974, he played his first One Day International (ODI) match, again against England, at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[54]

He received the Wetherell Award for leading all-rounder in English first-class cricket in 1976 and 1980.[55] By 1977, Khan was playing in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[56]


Khan's bowling statistics as a cricketer from 1971 to 1991.
As a bowler, Khan learned reverse swing from Sarfraz Nawaz and later taught it to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised it.[57][58] From January 1980 to 1988, Khan took 236 Test wickets at an average of 17.77, with 18 five-wicket hauls and five 10-wicket hauls, outperforming Richard Hadlee, Malcolm Marshall, Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding in average and strike rate.[59] Khan was the leading Test wicket-taker in 1982.[60] He recorded his best Test figures, taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka in 1981–82.[61]

Captaincy
In 1982, Khan became captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.[62] Under Khan, Pakistan won their first Test in England in 28 years at Lord's in 1982.[63] In 1983, he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.[64] During Pakistan's 1982–83 series against India, he took 40 wickets at an average of 13.95.[65] In January 1983, he became the second cricketer, after Ian Botham, to score a century and take 10 wickets in a Test.[66] The next month, he reached a Test bowling rating of 922 points,[k] the highest International Cricket Council (ICC) rating by anyone since World War I[67] and ranking third in ICC all-time Test bowling.[68] Khan became the first Pakistani bowler to take 200 Test wickets, with Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noting he "bowled with such venom and fire that no Indian batsman other than Mohinder Amarnath faced him with any confidence."[69] The series caused a stress fracture in his left shin, sidelining him over two years. Initially, he could bat but not bowl; later, he could not play at all. An experimental treatment in London, funded by the Pakistani government, helped him recover by late 1984. Khan returned under Javed Miandad's captaincy in the 1984–85 home series against Sri Lanka. Afterward, Miandad stepped down, citing a lack of full co-operation from Khan, who was then reappointed captain.[70]

Khan masterminded reforms in cricket umpiring to reduce criticism of Pakistani officials in home series.[71] Writing for The Guardian, Mike Selvey said that "such was his power" that in 1986 Khan invited Indian umpires VK Ramaswamy and Piloo Reporter to officiate a Test against West Indies, marking the first step in independent umpiring. He later brought England's John Hampshire and John Holder for the home series against India in 1989–90. This led to the 1994 rule requiring one neutral umpire and the 2002 mandate for both umpires to be independent.[72]

In 1987, Khan led Pakistan to its first Test series win in India, followed by its first series victory in England the same year.[63] Khan retired from international cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup.[73] He was asked to return as captain by General Zia-ul-Haq, and he accepted the offer.[74] In 1988, Khan led Pakistan on a successful West Indies tour.[75] He was named Man of the Series, taking 23 wickets in three Tests.[76][77] He became the first Asian and eighth non-Australian to win the International Cricketer of the Year in 1989.[78]

As captain, Khan led Pakistan in 48 Tests (14 wins, 8 losses, 26 draws) and 139 ODIs (75 wins, 59 losses, 1 tie).[62] In Tests, he holds the record for most wickets as captain, second-best innings figures (8/60), most five-wicket hauls in an innings (12), and most ten-wicket match hauls (4).[79]

1992 Cricket World Cup final

Khan led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.[81] In the final, he top-scored with 72 runs.[82] He brought back Wasim Akram in the 35th over after Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother had added 72 runs. Akram dismissed Lamb and Chris Lewis.[83] Khan claimed the final wicket himself.[82] This was Pakistan's first world cup victory.[83] After the victory, Khan said,

It was rock-bottom when we lost to South Africa. I told the boys they had to play as if they were cornered tigers. I told them to forget about bowling no-balls and wides, and just go out there and fight.[84]

Retirement
He played his last Test in January 1992 against Sri Lanka and retired after leading Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.[61]

Career stats
He ended his career with 88 Tests, 126 innings, scoring 3,807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries, 18 fifties, and a highest score of 136.[61] Khan had the second-highest all-time Test batting average of 61.86 playing at number six in the batting order.[85] As a bowler, he took 362 Test wickets.[61] He has won the most Player of the Series awards for Pakistan in Test cricket, ranking fourth overall in Test history.[86] In ODIs, he played 175 matches, scoring 3,709 runs at an average of 33.41, with a highest score of 102 not out.[61] His best ODI bowling was 6 for 14, the best figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.[87] Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple—3,000 runs and 300 wickets—in 75 Tests,[88] becoming one of the first four players to reach it. As of 2025, he is one of eleven players to do so,[89] and his 75-Test achievement is the third-fastest ever.[88]

Post-retirement from cricket
After retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during county cricket, saying he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam," and defended it by saying it was a commonplace practice.[90] He announced his return as a domestic league coach in May 2003.[91]

He occasionally appeared as a cricket commentator on Star TV.[92] In 2004, during the Indian cricket team's tour of Pakistan, he appeared as a commentator on TEN Sports' live show, Straight Drive.[93]

On 23 November 2005, Khan was appointed Chancellor of the University of Bradford.[94] In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[95] On 26 February 2014, the University of Bradford Union moved a no-confidence motion to remove him for missing all graduation ceremonies since 2010.[96] On 30 November 2014, he stepped down, citing "increasing political commitments," effectively resigning under union pressure.[97]

Philanthropy

Khan served as UNICEF Special Representative for Sports, promoting health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[98][99] In 1994, Khan founded Pakistan's first cancer hospital, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his mother,[100] who had died of cancer.[101] Khan raised funds by touring the country, with most donations coming from the poor.[100] He aimed to treat the poor free of charge, and as of 2024, 70 percent of patients receive free care.[101]

To aid victims of the 2001 Islamabad cloud burst, Khan auctioned his signed 1992 Cricket World Cup bat and match sweater; the bat alone fetched US$20,000. He said these were the last items he had, having earlier auctioned the rest for Shaukat Khanum Hospital.[102]

In December 2005, Khan, then Chancellor of the University of Bradford, signed a memorandum of understanding to establish Namal College in Mianwali as its associate college. Built by the Mianwali Development Trust on land donated by locals, it aimed to tackle unemployment through technical and vocational education.[103] The college opened in 2008.[104]

In 2006, while visiting his children in London, he also worked with the Lord's Taverners cricket charity.[100]

Khan established The Imran Khan Foundation (IKF) in February 2006.[105] In January 2013, IKF launched a Rs30 million relief project for internally displaced persons from the Mehsud tribe of North Waziristan neglected by the government, supplying food, winter essentials, and tents to 2,600 families in Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[106]

Political career
Initial years

Khan at a political rally in Peshawar in 1996
In 1987, President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a post in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which he declined. In 1993, Khan was appointed tourism ambassador in the caretaker government of Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi for three months until it was dissolved. In late 1994, he joined former ISI chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani of Pasban, a breakaway of Jamaat-e-Islami, to launch a "pressure group" as a civil society watchdog. Khan soon grew uncomfortable with being seen as Gul's puppet and left the group.[14]

In 1995, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fearing a military coup that could make Khan Prime Minister, acted with hostility. State television refused to air archival cricket footage and banned fundraising ads for his Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital during Ramadan. Authorities also spread rumours that Khan was suspected of embezzling hospital funds and being investigated for tax irregularities. Donations to the hospital halved that year as a result.[107]

On 25 April 1996, Khan founded the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[108] Nawaz Sharif invited Khan to join his party, offering second-in-command position and 30 National Assembly seats; Khan declined.[109] He ran for the National Assembly in the 1997 Pakistani general election from the constituencies — NA-53 Mianwali and NA-94 Lahore — as a PTI candidate but lost both to PML-N.[110]

Khan supported General Musharraf's 1999 Pakistani coup d'état,[111] believing Musharraf would "end corruption and clear out the political mafias."[112] Khan's PTI was among the parties that supported Pervez Musharraf in the 2002 Pakistani referendum.[113] Khan participated in the 2002 Pakistani general election and said that if his party did not win a majority, they would consider forming a coalition.[114] He was the only winner from PTI in that election.[115]


Khan in 2007
On 6 May 2005, Hendrik Hertzberg described Khan as "most directly responsible" for drawing attention in the Muslim world to the alleged desecration of the Qur'an at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.[116]

In August 2005, Declan Walsh called Khan a "miserable politician", saying "Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower... He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."[117]

In March 2006, Khan was escorted home by police and placed under house arrest after threatening to protest against President George W. Bush during his visit to Pakistan.[118]

On 2 October 2007, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, Khan joined 85 MPs in resigning from Parliament to protest the 2007 Pakistani presidential election, which General Musharraf contested without resigning as army chief.[119] On 3 November 2007, Khan was placed under house arrest after Musharraf declared a state of emergency; he later escaped from detention.[120] He emerged from hiding on 14 November to join a student protest at the University of the Punjab.[121] At the rally, activists from the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, dragged Khan into a building and held him in a headlock.[122] He was arrested during the protest and sent to the Central Jail, Dera Ghazi Khan, where he spent a week before release.[123]

He opposed the 2010 military operation in Kala Dhaka.[124]

On 30 October 2011, Khan addressed over 100,000 supporters in Lahore, challenging government policies, and calling his movement "not a flood that is coming, but a tsunami."[125] Another gathering of at least 100,000 supporters occurred in Karachi on 25 December 2011.[126]

In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats to Khan over his march to their tribal stronghold to protest U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, calling him a "liberal" and "secular" — terms they equated with being an infidel.[127] On 1 October, they withdrew death threats and offered him protection for the rally. They "endorse[d] Imran Khan's plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty."[128] On 6 October, Khan led a convoy of 10,000 to protest US drone strikes. The convoy was stopped by hundreds of security personnel just miles from South Waziristan's border. After an hour of failed negotiations, Khan announced the rally would return to Tank, about 15 kilometres away.[129]

2013 elections

Khan chose the cricket bat as the electoral symbol for his party in the 2013 elections, and it remained as such until 2023
On 21 April 2013, Khan launched his election campaign from Lahore, addressing thousands at The Mall.[130] Khan announced he would pull Pakistan from the US-led war on terror and bring peace to the Pashtun tribal belt.[131] He announced PTI would introduce a uniform education system giving rich and poor children equal opportunities.[132] Khan concluded his campaign in South Punjab's Seraiki belt by addressing rallies in various cities.[133]

On 7 May, four days before the elections, Khan fell from a lifter while boarding a stage at a rally, sustaining head injuries,[134] and four fractured vertebrae.[135] He ended the campaign by addressing a rally in Islamabad via video link from his hospital bed.[136]

The 2013 Pakistani general election was held on 11 May. The Pakistan Muslim League (N), headed by Nawaz Sharif, won, while Khan alleged vote-rigging.[137] The day after the elections, Asad Umar, a leader from his party, announced that Khan had conceded defeat to PML (N).[138] While Khan's party welcomed the vote, he pledged to release a white paper on alleged rigging and vowed protests.[139]

His party became the leading party in the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[140] Khan nominated Pervez Khattak to lead his party's first provincial government.[141]

In opposition

Khan became his party's parliamentary leader in the National Assembly of Pakistan after the 2013 elections.[142] He received a contempt-of-court notice on 31 July 2013 for allegedly criticising the superior judiciary as "shameful."[143] The notice was discharged after he told the Supreme Court of Pakistan that his criticism targeted lower-court judicial officers serving as returning officers during the 2013 elections.[144]

Khan was criticised for supporting Sami-ul-Haq, the "Father of the Taliban," and funding his seminary, Darul Uloom Haqqania.[145] He accused the US of sabotaging peace with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone strike in 2013. He threatened protests and to block NATO's supply lines to Afghanistan if drone attacks, which he said "fanned fanaticism," continued.[146]

Voice of America reports on Khan-led protest, August 2014
On 11 May 2014, a year after the elections, Khan demanded the resignation of all Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) members, a new ECP, and strict punishment for those who "stole the mandate of the masses."[147] On 14 August 2014, Khan led a rally from Lahore to Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation and an investigation into alleged electoral fraud.[148] Khan and Canadian-Pakistani cleric Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri formed a "de facto" alliance to mobilise supporters for a regime-change campaign against Sharif.[149][150]

In 2014, then-PTI president Javed Hashmi alleged Khan was instructed by the army to coordinate his protests with Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Qadri.[142] Hashmi accused Khan of being "influenced by a 'signal' from outside," which The New York Times called "an apparent reference to military intervention."[151] The Inter-Services Public Relations said it backed neither PTI nor PAT. The army acted as mediator between the protesters and the government.[152] In 2016, Hashmi said Khan had "conspired" with "disgruntled elements in the army".[153] In the Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Pakistan, Aparna Pande, a Research Fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes that sections of the army backed the protests; Khan was advised by then ISI chief Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the ISI drafted Qadri to lead them.[154]

Khan urged supporters to burn electricity bills, refuse to pay taxes, and join civil disobedience. PTI protesters forced their way into state-run PTV's Islamabad studios, creating chaos, assaulting staff and journalists, and engaging in hooliganism.[155] On 1 September, protesters led by Qadri and Khan attempted to storm Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's official residence, triggering violence that left three dead and over 595 injured, including 115 police officers.[156] After the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, Khan ended his 126-day sit-in on 17 December in the interest of national unity.[157]

In March 2015, Khan's party agreed with the Sharif administration to form a judicial commission to probe electoral fraud, a move facilitated by Army Chief General Raheel Sharif.[158] In July, the commission found the elections broadly fair with no systemic rigging.[159] Khan accepted the commission's findings but said he had not received a copy.[160]

Khan campaigned against Nawaz Sharif after the Panama Papers leaks in 2016, leading protests and calling for his resignation over corruption allegations.[161] Khan called the Panama Papers case a "defining moment" for the country.[162]

Khan contested the 2018 Pakistani general election from NA-35 (Bannu),[163] NA-53 (Islamabad-II),[164] NA-95 (Mianwali-I),[165] NA-131 (Lahore-IX),[166] and NA-243 (Karachi East-II).[167] Khan became the first in Pakistan elections history to contest and win all five constituencies, surpassing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who contested four and won three in 1970.[168]

Opposition parties alleged "massive rigging" and military interference in Khan's favour.[169] Nawaz Sharif and PML (N) alleged that the military aligned with the judiciary manipulated the election in Khan's favour.[170] The Election Commission rejected the allegations.[171] Two days after the 2018 elections, Michael Gahler, chief observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission to Pakistan, said the overall situation of the election was satisfactory.[172]

Nominations and appointments
On 6 August 2018, his party nominated him for prime minister.[173] He designated Asad Umar as finance minister for his upcoming government.[174] He nominated Mahmood Khan for Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[175] and Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.[176] In Balochistan, Khan directed his party to back the Balochistan Awami Party, which nominated Jam Kamal Khan as chief minister and Abdul Quddus Bizenjo as speaker.[177]

General Asim Munir as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.[179] Khan initially held the Ministry of Interior portfolio after forming his cabinet.[180]

Domestic policy
Economy

On taking office, Khan cut spending by reducing PM staff from 524 to 2,[181] and auctioning eight buffaloes and 61 luxury vehicles previously acquired for the PM's office.[182] He was criticised for using a helicopter to commute while promoting austerity.[183]

In June 2020, Bloomberg said Khan's popularity was falling due to a weak economy, inflation, and corruption probes involving his aides.[184] In 2021, official records showed that PM House expenses and PM Office budget fell by 49% and 29%, respectively.[185] His 12 foreign trips cost $680,000, which was less than a single New York visit by his predecessors.[186] After Khan's no-confidence, economist Atif Mian said he inherited a bad economy and left it worse, adding there was "zero increase in average income" with Pakistan still in a balance of payments crisis.[187]

Environment and energy
